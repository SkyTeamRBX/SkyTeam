We are more than excited to announce our new visual redesign for SkyTeam. Our new redesign brings a bold, modern look that reflects our commitment to innovation, collaboration and excellence across the SkyTeam ROBLOX community.

This redesign includes an all-new experience on our own website [skyteam.dev](https://skyteam.dev/) - where you can explore flights, press releases and our _upcoming miles system_.

As we approach our two year anniversary this coming New Year, we’re reflecting on how far we’ve come; and looking forward to what’s next. In the months ahead, we’ll begin testing and gradually integrating our Miles System across partner airlines, enhancing the way members connect and earn through the SkyTeam network.

We’re also excited to announce that applications for new airlines will reopen this winter, welcoming more carriers into our growing alliance.

To our partners, airline staff, and community: thank you for being part of our journey. Your support continues to inspire us as we move into our next chapter together.
